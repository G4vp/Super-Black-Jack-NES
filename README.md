# Black Jack NES
The project aims to develop a game for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) console,
programming exclusively in ASM code for the 6502 processor. For this semester, the challenge is
to develop a simplified Blackjack game where the player bets against the house to see who gets
closer to 21 in their hand.
